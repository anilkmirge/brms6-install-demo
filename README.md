Steps:

Download the following from the JBoss Customer Portal: http://access.redhat.com

 * EAP6 (jboss-eap-6.1.1.zip)
 * BRMS deployable (jboss-brms-6.0.0.GA-redhat-2-deployable-eap6.x.zip)

Copy the above two files into installs directory for the init.sh script to work.

Ensure that this file is executable by running:

chmod +x <path-to-project>/installs/jboss-eap-6.1.1.zip
chmod +x <path-to-project>/installs/jboss-brms-6.0.0.GA-redhat-2-deployable-eap6.x.zip
